# Configuring Hitch

Hitch can be configured either from command line arguments or from a
configuration file on disk.

You can extract the usage description by invoking Hitch with the "--help"
argument. An example configuration file is included in the distribution.

In general Hitch is a protocol agnostic proxy and does not need much configuration.

List of configuration items to consider:

  - PEM files with key and certificate.
  - Listening addresses and ports. Note the semi-odd square brackets for IPv4 addresses.
  - Which backend servers to proxy towards, and if PROXY protocol should be used.
  - Number of workers, usually 1. For larger setups, use one worker per core.

If you need to support legacy clients, you can consider:

  - Enable SSLv3 with "--ssl" (despite RFC7568.)
  - Use weaker ciphers.

## Specifying ciphers

The recommended default is:

    "EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH"

If you need to support legacy clients, consider the "HIGH" cipher group.

Normally you do not have to change this.


## Run environment

If you're handling a large number of connections, you'll probably want to raise
`ulimit -n` before running Hitch.

If you are listening to ports under 1024 (443 comes to mind), you need
to start Hitch as root. In those cases you *must* use --user/-u to set
a non-privileged user `hitch` can setuid() to.


## Preparing PEM files

PEM files should contain the key file, the certificate from the CA and any
intermediate CAs needed.

   $ cat example.com.key intermediate.pem example.com.crt > example.com.pem

If you want to use Diffie-Hellman based ciphers for Perfect Forward Secrecy
(PFS), you need to add some parameters for that as well:

    $ openssl dhparam -rand - 2048 >> example.com.pem

Hitch will complain and disable DH unless these parameters are available.
